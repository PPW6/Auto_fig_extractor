# Curve Data Extraction - Enhanced Version

This repository is based on the original automated curve data extraction project by [Baibakova, V., Elzouka, M., Lubner, S. et al. Optical emissivity dataset of multi-material heterogeneous designs generated with automated figure extraction. Sci Data 9, 589 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01699-3](https://github.com/ViktoriiaBaib/curvedataextraction.git). Below is a simplified installation and usage guide.

---

## ðŸ”§ Installation (Simplified)

### 1. Create and activate conda environment

```bash
conda create -n imgrec python=3.9
conda activate imgrec
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.7 protobuf==3.20.2 easyocr==1.7.1 opencv-python==4.6.0.66
```

### 3. Clone and install TF Object Detection API

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
cd models/research
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
cp object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py .
python -m pip install .
python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py  # Check install
```

### 4. Download Pretrained Assets

Download from (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e0UTKwhgJN9DuD2qYsLcWcKd6WomvRkl/view?usp=sharing) and place the files accordingly in:
- `inference_graph/`
- `training/`
- `images/`
- `utils/`
- `protos/`
- `core/`

### 5. Run Extraction Pipeline

```bash
cd object_detection

# Run axis and legend detection
python object_detection_curves.py

# Run color decomposition
python color_decomposition.py

# Run final processing
python final_achieve.py
```

## âœ… Modifications Made

We made the following customizations based on the original project:

- Reorganized code into a modular pipeline.
- Added `origin_data` class for structured batch processing.
- Adjusted image and axis parsing logic to improve error handling.
- Integrated EasyOCR and automatic axis scaling refinement.
